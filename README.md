# Standard
Our Standard API endpoint is the easiest and fastest way to access our exchange rate data.
```go
    apiKey := ""
	client := exchangerateapi.New(*http.DefaultClient, apiKey)

	sd, err := client.Standard("USD")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error => ", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Response ::: ", sd)
```

# PairConversion
Our Pair Conversion API endpoint is useful for applications where you just want to convert between two specific currencies and aren't interested in any others.
```go
    apiKey := ""
	client := exchangerateapi.New(*http.DefaultClient, apiKey)

	pr, err := client.PairConversion("NGN", "USD")
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error => ", err)
	}

	fmt.Println("Response ::: ", pr)
```
